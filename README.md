# Mix-Edition
This mod adds more content to Arcade Future Tone such as songs, modules, new features, etc. It is only available for the Arcade version, as FT and Megamix only support up to 300 songs due to having fixed savedatas.

# Installing
  - Download the gdrive files, all 001-012 files (winrar or 7z is required. Either one will work).
  - Make sure the 001-012 files are all in the same folder. Doesn't matter which folder.
  - Extract the contents of 001 only to your diva's game folder.

  - Disable extended data/osage_play_data (disables the extended data installation. This is mostly if you don't want to wait about 2 hours for the install, and it's also a 13GB increase. It'll break physics on edit mode PVs however)
